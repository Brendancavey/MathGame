<h2>Technical Description</h2>
This web application is built using the ASP.NET MVC Core framework, C#, and Razor to create a server-side application. It leverages ASP.NET Core's Entity framework to establish an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) for seamless connectivity with a local SQL Server. Model binding is implemented to facilitate the automatic mapping of incomming HTTP request data to the corresponding action method parameters. The application also utlizes ASP.NET Core's Identity framework to incorporate authentication with authorization.The SQL Server is managed and debugged using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). For the client-side, HTML, CSS, and Javascript are used, and the application is stylized using the CSS framework, Bootstrap.
